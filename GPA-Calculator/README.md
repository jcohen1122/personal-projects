<h1>Run Folder</h1>

<h2>Grade Calculator</h2>
The Grade Calculator file is an Unix executable file intended to execute the GradeCalc.jar file from the terminal. The benefit of doing this roundabout way of executing the already executable jar file is because opening it from the terminal allows the program to have access to personal folders, which is needed when saving/loading a grade file. When the program is loaded just through the jar, the program does not have access to any folders.

<h2>GradeCalc.jar</h2>
This file will execute the program.

<h2>Fall 22 Grades.txt</h2>
This is a JSON text file containing all of my current grades for the Fall 22 semester. The format was created by saving through the program and not done by hand, and the file's purpose is to allow the testing of the save/load methods within the program.
